Go Coding Rules:

from http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~wjh/go/rules/Japanese.html

1. Players choose a color (black/white) and place stones alternatively starting with black

2. Stone are placed on empty intersections on the board (look@googs)
	>OG board is 19x19, but can play on 9x9 or 13x13
	>cannot be placed on an empty space that gives zero liberties (explained below)
		>considered ILLEGAL MOVE
		>UNLESS the move captures stones (look @ "Ko" below for example)
			>so UNLESS the stone gains liberties from the move

3. A placed stone has four "liberties" (un-attached adjacent side)
	>Liberties are to the top, bottom, left, and right of stone (N/W/S/E)
	>A stone loses liberties when enemy stone is "attached" to it
	>A stone can gain liberties by connecting friendly stones
		>e.g. Two friendly stones have a total of 6 liberties

		+ + + + + +
		+ + o o + +
		+ o O O o +
		+ + o o + +
		+ + + + + +

		>above, Big O are stones, little o are liberties, + are empty intersections

	>stones that have 0 liberties are captured and removed from play
		>this is called a capture, captured stones are removed and put in captured pile
		>so a stone or group of stones surrounded on all (N/W/S/E) sides is removed

	>a lone stone on the board's corners has only two liberties
		>e.g. NW corner stone will have liberties only to East and South

	>a lone stone on the border of the board has 3 liberties
		>Say stone on left-hand border, liberties to North, South, and East

4. "Ko" is a particular shape where both players can continously capture the the space

	> B = black stones, W = white stones, + = empty intersection

	+ + + + + +
	+ + B W + +
	+ B + B W +
	+ + B W + +
	+ + + + + +

	>In above, White can capture B's rightmost stone by placing a stone in empty space 		surrounded by B
	> B can then recapture and it goes on and on
	>Go rules state both players must make a non-ko move before the Ko can be played again
		>so both players playing in any other spot will allow Ko plays for next turn

5. Territory

	>Empty intersections surrounded by same-side teams (or the board walls) are territory
	>In the Ko example, the + between the B stones counts as one territory

6. Game Ends when both players pass or one player resigns
	>points are then rewarded and player w/most points wins

7. Point counting (Japanese Rules)
	>Remove opposing stones in each player's territory and add to captured pile
		>UNLESS the enemy stone is protecting its own territory
	>Stones that you've captured then fill up the enemy's territory
		>So, points = (your territory) - (stones captured by enemy)
